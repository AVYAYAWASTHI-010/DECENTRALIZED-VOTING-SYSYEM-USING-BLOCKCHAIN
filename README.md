## 3. Tech Stack

The project was built using the following technologies:<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain (Ethereum / Solidity)** ‚Äì Core platform for smart contract-based voting<br>
‚Ä¢ üêç **Python (Flask)** ‚Äì Backend framework for APIs and system integration<br>
‚Ä¢ üåê **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** ‚Äì Frontend interface for voter interaction<br>
‚Ä¢ üì¶ **Web3.js / Web3.py** ‚Äì Blockchain interaction with frontend and backend<br>
‚Ä¢ üóÑÔ∏è **IPFS / Local DB** ‚Äì Optional storage for off-chain data<br>
‚Ä¢ üìÅ **File Format** ‚Äì `.sol` for smart contracts, `.py` for backend, `.html`/`.css`/`.js` for UI

## 4. Data Source
- **Blockchain Ledger**: Stores votes in a decentralized, immutable format.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Define rules for voter registration, authentication, and ballot casting.  
- **Frontend Inputs**: Voters cast votes via the UI, securely recorded on-chain.

## 5. Features / Highlights

### ‚Ä¢ Business Problem
Traditional electronic voting systems face issues of **security, centralization, and trust**. Fraud and manipulation reduce credibility.

### ‚Ä¢ Goal of the Project
- Build a **tamper-proof decentralized voting system** using blockchain.  
- Ensure **voter anonymity** while allowing result verification.  
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for casting and counting votes.  

### ‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Features
- **Voter Registration**: Smart contract-based validation of eligible voters.  
- **Vote Casting**: Each vote is recorded immutably on the blockchain.  
- **Anonymity & Security**: Votes are encrypted and unlinkable to voter identities.  
- **Real-Time Counting**: Results can be tracked transparently from the blockchain ledger.  
- **Decentralization**: Removes dependency on a central authority for result validation.  

### ‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights
- **Trust Building**: Increases credibility of elections through transparency.  
- **Fraud Prevention**: Immutable records reduce tampering risks.  
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for organizational, university, or national-level voting.
